# Angular-Universal with Java backend using J2V8
This repository contains a simple (and very initial) example of using angular-universal with java backend using J2V8.

##Features:
- Rendering using angular universal from java using J2V8
- Serving both the application and other rest endpoint from java using sparkjava
- Basic live-reload support for the universal server build 
- Linux x64 only
- Multi-Node (each in its own thread) rendring
- Java level cache for increasing performance (using the cache assumes that the render function is pure)
- The renderer itself (not including the usage example) dependes on J2V8 and Guava

##TODO:
- Fetch J2V8 from maven central
- Support other platforms
- Performance tests 
- Documentation and code-cleanup
- Orginize project structure
- Implement a more complex client side application
- ~~Check if can model the bootstrap configuration object in java in order to remove the need for server.js completely~~ 
- ~~Cleanup and improvement of the JavaEngine (currently almost blindly based on the expressEngine)~~
- ~~Remove the direct gson dependency~~
- ~~Expose the cache through configuration~~
- ~~Make the configuration object api fluid~~

##Requirements
- x64 Linux (tested on ubuntu 16.04)
- Java 8
- Maven
- NPM
 
##Running Instructions
1. Clone the repository
2. Install node dependencies (`npm install`)
3. Build the java server(`mvn clean package`)
4. Build&Watch angular-universal + angular client side code (`npm start`)
5. Execute the java server (`mvn -e exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="hello.ngu.j2v8.Server"`)
6. Open your browser on `http://localhost:3000/app/`

###Thanks and credits
- The Angular-Universal-related files are based on Angular 2 Universal starter kit with very small modifications
- Special thanks to @irbull for the great J2V8 library and he's help.
